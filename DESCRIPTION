Description: The package will contain two different functions for solving what is called the knapsack problem.     
     The knapsack problem is a discrete optimization problem where we have a knapsack that can take a limited     
     weight W and we want to fill this knapsack with a number of items i = 1, ..., n, each with a weight w and     
     a value v. The goal is to find the knapsack with the largest value of the elements added to the knapsack.
